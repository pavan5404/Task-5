# Task 5 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

---

# Objective
The objective of this task is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python. The goal is to extract meaningful insights, identify patterns, and visualize relationships within the data through statistical summaries and graphical techniques. This process helps in understanding the data structure, detecting anomalies, discovering trends, and laying the foundation for future predictive modeling or decision-making processes
